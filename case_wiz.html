                            <p class="sec-text-dark">Homotech does not lack strategy or analysis ; what it needs is a strong narrative to connect all business units, and communicate in a way that a consumer can resonate with. Being aware of the dominant deductive culture, we instead leaned heavily on visual and audio exploration to provoke different points of view and sentiment on what the brand could be. </p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">The design started from day one with the brand team when audited key touch points together while building mood boards to dissect what it meant to be “Intelligence with compassion.” We then consolidated ideas into three distinct brand propositions, which were  tangible enough to trigger strong feedback and bring alignment among the stakeholders.</p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">Following the chosen direction, we built prototypes in runs of iteration to define the right narrative and market position, deepen the visual expression, and see/envisage how it could scale as a system across all touchpoints. We finally converted the system into a design toolkit to help the Homotech team to realise  their vision. </p>

In parallel, we used the learning we had  to expand the words “Intelligence with compassion,” by developing a set of keywords and future scenarios, building mood boards, and various narratives along the way.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We showcased our work every day in the dining area and invited all the employees to share feedback with us. This participatory process allowed us to quickly understand the company from all levels while narrowing down the proposal from nine to three distinct brand propositions - The principle of nature; The new conversation;, and Bold curiosity.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">Next, we invited all stakeholders in Homotech, including the CEO, to a workshop, where we shared the three brand proposals in an immersive setting. We used video to tell the brand story, combining with the visual rendering on their major touch points such as the landing page, product, and data dashboard. This  rich visual expression provoked a strong sentiment among the group, helping us to drive the conversation deep into which direction to go and how it could  evolve to support Homotech’s future strategy . It iwas  clear that everyone appreciated the beauty and intricacy of the first direction - the Principle of Nature, but also felt  it needed more human qualities, to show the care that Homotech wanted to bring to the world.</p>

To do that, we first studied the  top tech brands across new ventures, startups, and enterprises in both Chinese  and global markets to Understand what the story they were telling was, and more importantly, how they delivered it to the audience. To process it more systematically, I created a framework to hold all the evidence we found to see how the storytelling format evolved at the company scale, and how its  portfolio had grown . This study not only helped us draw inspiration from those successful players but also informed us how we should position Homotech for the present and future as the company evolves.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">As we developed the brand narrative, we kept experimenting with  what the visual language might be to best express the message. The exploration became  two-fold. On the one hand, we kept writing slogans and mini-stories to extract the core elements from the narrative and used /using that to evolve the mood board to find the right look and feel for what the story was delivering. On the other hand, we used these visual elements to build and test the visual expression on the key touchpoints. This dual exploration helped us to explore multiple possibilities while keeping our ideas grounded. After countless iterations, we finally landed on a sweet spot with the brand team - a visual system that spokes elegant, constant movements, and smooth transitions.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">The final step was to make sure the brand system could  scale and work across products and services in Homotech, as the company was  expecting to expand its portfolio in the coming years. Since digital would l play a significant role in their future portfolio, I worked closely with our visual lead to apply the brand system extensively on every digital component we could  imagine - the enterprise website, the EnOS Dashboard, the smart building app, the mobile charger interface, or even the employee's smart badge. To further test the system, we invited our partner team, who were working on the client’s smart building project, to adopt our brand system in their work. This rigorous process helped us to foresee any potential gaps and fill them before we handed it to the brand team.</p>
