                    <p class="sec-text">Most digital wallets today are built for a single purpose — limiting their value across identity, payments, and digital assets. At the same time, trust has become a growing concern for users: 62% say it's critical when choosing a brand. People want more control over their data; businesses need secure, privacy-first ways to deliver personalized services. Combining Accenture's global expertise in digital transformation with NTT Digital's deep knowledge of Web3 infrastructure, the joint venture is building Universal Wallet Infrastructure (UWI) — an open, interoperable platform that empowers both users and businesses to manage digital assets securely and unlock value in the next generation of digital services.</p>

                            <h3 class="sec-subtitle-dark">Designing for Scale with Unknowns</h3>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">The UWI platform is only valuable if businesses want to use it. From the start, we knew adoption was critical — without early adopters, the ecosystem wouldn't take off. In the meantime, a few potential partners showed interest, but they needed to see something tangible before committing.</p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">This posed a clear challenge: how do we design white-label products that demonstrate value of the platform, but later can easily scale and tailor to each partner's needs? With limited clarity on the use cases, we made assumptions, built demos, and tested with potential users. Our design team focused on validating whether the core feature has met the user needs — and whether the product could scale as more services joined.</p>
                            <p class="sec-text-dark">Guided by insights from marketing, partner feedback, and user testing, we refined the experience and launched the MVP from 0 to 1. We built three core experience components: credential issuance, sharing, and management — forming the foundation of the credential lifecycle and setting the stage for the platform to grow and evolve.</p>

                                <h3 class="sec-subtitle-dark">Defining the MVP scope</h3>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">When we kicked off the project, the marketing team was already building public awareness of the platform. But to move from vision to reality, we needed an MVP that could demonstrate real value — while staying lean enough to iterate and test quickly in the market.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">With the goal in mind, we worked with the product and concept design teams to identify opportunity areas with high impact and low dependency. Identity emerged as the natural starting point. As the foundation of all digital transactions, a trusted identity layer is critical for enabling secure, seamless experiences across services. And to build the identity lifecycle we focused on three core flows: credential issuance, sharing, and management. These flows form the backbone of the UWI service and lay the groundwork for the platform to scale.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">To accelerate adoption, we targeted the U.S. market. The federal government is actively promoting digital identity adoption, and several states — including California, Colorado, Maryland, and Arizona — are already piloting mobile driver's licenses (mDLs). With TSA set to accept mDLs starting May 2025, this gave us a clear use case and a strong path to early deployment.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">Since UWI's goal is to help businesses and individuals better manage digital assets, and more specifically identity credentials, we started by understanding how things work today — and where the gaps and pain points lie.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We identified three key user archetypes involved in the identity lifecycle: data consumers, data providers, and wallet holders. We analyzed the tools and workflows used to issue, receive, share, and manage credentials, and created hypothetical personas to help the team visualize each user's goals, needs, and challenges.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">To ground our research, we chose job onboarding as a real-world use case. We interviewed internal employees about their experience receiving and using credentials during onboarding, and spoke with HR to understand how they verify and manage employee data before and after hiring.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">From these findings, we mapped a user journey covering each stage of the credential lifecycle. The result revealed a fragmented system — full of inefficiencies, distrust, and uncertainty about credential status. It also highlighted a key truth: every business has different workflows. For UWI to succeed, the platform needs to be flexible enough to adapt to those differences.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">But here comes the challenge: the team was fully distributed across the U.S., Japan, India, Slovakia, and Singapore — spanning nearly every time zone. To stay aligned, we worked with the product manager and scrum master to establish a tight 5-day design sprint: understand, explore, iterate, review, and deliver. The process emphasized clear documentation on JIRA and async communication such as figma comments to make sure every team member had timely information on ownership, tasks, and visibility into risks or blockers. This allows the whole team to keep the momentum without compromising quality.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">To evaluate usability and validate key assumptions about our MVP, we conducted two rounds of 1:1 user testing with 10 internal colleagues. The first session focused on the baseline wallet experience, using a job onboarding scenario to test credential flows such as identity verification, document sharing, and badge issuing. The second session extended into real-world use cases of mobile driver's licenses (mDL), covering three connected scenarios: mDL enrollment, sharing for car rental, and age verification at a bar — along with verifier-side interactions.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">These sessions helped us assess feature comprehension, task efficiency, and the overall experience across products. We uncovered quick wins, such as addressing unfamiliar terminology, redundant steps, and inconsistent navigation patterns that slowed down task completion. We also surfaced deeper questions, including the need for wallet home page customization and user preferences around data sharing and disclosure. These insights helped guide design decisions and prioritize future improvements that better align with both user expectations and business goals.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">To accelerate the MVP delivery, the team integrated several off-the-shelf technologies to reduce development time and ensure compliance with security and policy standards. These included Mattr's Go Hold app for credential issuance and wallet functionality, Amazon Cognito for login and account management, and FaceTec's biometric SDK for liveness detection and document verification.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">This approach helped us move faster and avoid building complex infrastructure from scratch. However, it also introduced challenges — most notably rigid UI constraints and inconsistent interaction patterns that didn't align with our overall experience. To address this, we studied each SDK in detail and worked closely with developers to identify what could be adapted or improved. Through this collaboration, we were able to find a middle-ground that balanced technical limitations with a consistent, user-friendly experience across the product.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">Another key challenge we faced was turning the brand's visual concept into the actual product experience. In more mature organizations, this is usually supported by a well-established design system and a dedicated support team. But since the system was still in its infancy, we had to build it while designing the product itself.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">This required close collaboration across the design team. As we created screens for real features, we continuously shaped and tested components in parallel — making sure everything we built was consistent, on-brand, and flexible enough for evolving use cases. It took about 3–4 sprints for the team to build fluency and confidence in translating brand principles into usable UI patterns.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">Throughout the process, we worked together to propose updates to the shared library — from icons and buttons to color, spacing, and layout rules — ensuring the system was not only visually cohesive but also practical for both designers and developers to implement.</p>

This shared record makes it easier to see what happened, when it happened, and who was involved, whether it is for a refund, audit, or follow up. It also creates opportunities for more personalized and connected services. For example, if your flight changes, you could receive suggestions to update your travel insurance or hotel booking accordingly.</p>
