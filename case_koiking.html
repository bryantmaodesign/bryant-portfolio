Throughout the project, we work hand in hand with the product designers to set goals, define priorities, broke down the exiting UI elements, studied the workflow, and explore visual directions for the redesign. </p>

The insights helped us to quickly refine and evaluate the proposal with the client.

We met the two client teams respectively to clarify their needs and assumptions about the product and consumer while sitting down with the product team to learn about their philosophy, and the newly developed features and design language. In the process, we also learned some hardware limitations that would l eventually impact the UI design. The review taught us a few key points that helped us to focus our efforts down the line.</p>

Therefore, we first studied the current hood and dishwasher UI to inform ourselves of how the two products worked. Then we broke down all the functions and status, laying out the information architecture and workflow to explore how a user might interact with the product in different contexts. This process helped us to uncover the superfluous  parts and missing links of the system, providing opportunities to create a much simpler yet more delightful user flow.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">With the new structure in hand, we now had a foundation to build the new visual language upon. In order to be more generative, we first listed all the visual elements of  the two products that we could  possibly play with, including the tone of the copy, font, color, icon, layout, motion, sound, and even tactility.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">In parallel, we extracted keywords from the product design principle, and expanded the existing mood board to provide broader visual inspiration for both the product and interaction team. This dual effort helped us to quickly explore multiple possibilities without losing sight of our goal , generating three distinct UI proposals for both products which were ready to be tested in the field. </p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">As  the time was short, we were eager to see how the consumer might resonate with the new UI proposals. We spent 2 days building real size, hi-fidelity prototypes with ambient sound to mimic the kitchen scenario. Then we recruited 5 participants based on Square’s  consumer profile who cooked regularly, owned a high-end range hood and dishwasher, and were  key decision makers on kitchen appliances. Then we recruited 5 participants based on Square’s  consumer profile: regular cooks, owners of a high end range hood and dishwasher and key decision makers in purchasing kitchen appliances.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We asked about their ideal brand and the experience of using the hood and dishwasher. We then invited them to try out the prototype while thinking out loud to tell us what was going on in their mind. This result not only helped us to clarify some questions on brand perception and usability, but also inspired the team to think more extensively by uncovering some hidden scenarios that we had not considered , for example , looking from the living room to check if the dishwasher had finished.</p>

In the session, we walked them through the three UI proposals and played back the insights from the consumer research. The prototypes helped the Square team to fully grasp the design intent while running a quick assessment of its market value, cost, and feasibility. This  enabled us  to prioritize the proposals for both range hood and dishwasher, and have a clear view of how to refine the design and push it forward.</p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">While the workshop gave us a clear alignment on which direction to go in, the final UI design remained unresolved since the clients were  pushing for a much more  iconic design and many technical challenges remained to be settled. To address  the issue, we went back to our drawing board, conducting runs of brainstorming sessions with the product team on how to evolve the chosen UI directions.</p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">We came up with over 50 ideas in one day, built them in real size and put them side by side to mimic how an idea might stand out to a consumer in the store . In the meantime, we collaborated with a motion designer to explore how the UI might perform   in key functions like switching on/off, button click, operating etc. These efforts helped us to nail down the final solution with the core team and get ready to bring the solutions to the board room.</p>

They considered the UI to elegantly blend with the product design and connect well with the legacy of its predecessor. The CEO was especially drawn to the rangehood UI, as it symbolized his Chinese ideal of harmony and peace. The company aimed to launch the two new flagship products by the early of 2021.</p>

We brought in real size prototypes for both rangehood and dishwasher, played back consumer insights, and walked them through the new UI structure and visual language. By experiencing the prototype, the leadership members could  easily imagine how the new UI might stand out from the shelf and support their consumers’ daily tasks. The positive feedback quickly moved the conversation forward to the launch timeline and how we could work with the core team to bring the two products to life.</p>
