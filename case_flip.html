                    <p class="sec-text">Eastland is one of the biggest property developers in China based in Shenzhen. Despite acquired land in Suhe creek, a promising historic area in Shanghai, the team struggled to harness its unique assets to create a vision that stands out from the commercialized market. The local policy further complicates the issue, in which most of the commercial activities need to go underground to leave the existing park open to citizens. The leadership team brought the challenge to us and asked for an integrated way of thinking - leading a multidisciplinary team to build a new landmark that put a strong strategy foothold in Eastern China.</p>

In the meantime, we also work with experts from art, history, and city planning to draw inspiration from the best practices.

By working with Eastland and the partner design firm, we iterate the value proposition and concept through a series of evaluations and prioritization. This process helps the group recognize the strengths that they can play, with trade-offs to be made to push the vision forward. The design went from overall positioning to the actual floor plan, leasing, and programming, providing an anchor for the leadership to see the final resolution of the shopping complex.</p>
