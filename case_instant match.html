Tokyo, in particular, faces a job-to-job seeker ratio of 1.14, indicating high job demand but limited candidates. While companies like DODA and RikuNavi Next offer resume search features, about half of employers have discontinued their use due to time constraints and concerns about job seeker empowerment.</p>

                            <p class="sec-text-dark">With previous research and market insights, we formulate our design assumptions, build prototypes and validate them through rigorous testing with japan users.

Firstly, we aim to build a matching product to enhance engagement between employer and job seeker and ultimately lead to more hires.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">Next, we need to define our target users. From the desktop research, we know that 99.5% of companies in Japan are small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and approximately 95% of them are companies with 1-29 employees.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">These small businesses are usually restrained on resources. People who are responsible for hiring often lack the necessary knowledge, tools, and time to find the right talent. These self-serve users are our primary focus as they comprise most of our user base.
                                </p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">On the other hand, many of our existing paid users are hiring agencies who use Indeed to help larger companies post jobs or source candidates. Therefore, we also need to consider how to integrate this workflow.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">The previous research and user archetype helped us formulate the initial design assumptions. Firstly, we discovered that despite the familiarity with sourcing products and services, Japanese employers often find them indifferent, the recommended jobs or candidates tend to be too generic and do not align with their experience or requirements. Secondly, we learned that Japanese job seekers are cautious and require more information before applying, suggesting the need for further explanation of the new services.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">With the US product on hand, we quickly implemented changes based on these assumptions, built prototypes, and tested them with our target users—both employers and job seekers. The result reveals several interesting finding that impacts the design down the line:

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">One major challenge we faced in launching our matching product in Japan was complying with legal requirements. In Japan, Indeed holds a license as an information provider. This means we must present information neutrally without favoring or hiding anything from the users. This poses a problem as matching is inherently selective service.   
                                </p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">So we collaborated with the PM and legal teams to explore alternatives that would satisfy policy requirements. Firstly, we show recommended candidates while offering a general search so employers can freely access the entire resume pool on Indeed. Secondly, we prioritized top results and preserved the long tail through pagination. And finally, we set some basic criteria to use the serivce, so employers and job seekers will get more relevant recommendations.
                                </p>
                                 <p class="sec-text-dark">Although it took months to resolve, the legal battle helped us prioritize essential experience while maintaining Indeed's legitimacy in the local market.
                                </p>

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">With these insights in mind, it's time to assemble the matching product and candidate platform. To ensure we maximize the outcome and minimize the impact with other initiatives, we brought together key stakeholders, including PMs, designers, and developers from immediate, Indeed, and third-party teams. We host a four-day hybrid design sprint, discussing the product vision, identifying opportunity areas, risk, and feasibility to define the roadmap and MVP plan. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">The productive session yielded vision alignment and end-to-end MVP flows. Additionally, we highlighted some key technical assumptions for all parties to explore further, such as the possibility of a common data format and APIs for building the matching and searching functions.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">While we are building the matching service, a parallel team is also planning an initiative to facilitate engagement between employers and job seekers through lightweight connections such as messages or calls.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">To ensure both projects will coexist well on the ATS platform, I worked with the lead designer to lay out the end-to-end applicant tracking journey and built a prototype to test with our Japanese employers.
                                </p>
                                <p class="sec-text-dark">The results show a positive sign: Employers appreciate seeing both matched and connected candidates on the ATS dashboard, allowing them to reach out when they need more applicants. However, many find it confusing to see the candidates together with those who already applied for the job. These insights, along with a few others, provide us with a clear direction on how to iterate the design to fulfill their day-to-day hiring tasks.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">The move to being a platform-based product raises several questions and challenges in UX. For example, which protocols and design standards should we follow? What should be configurable and what should be tailor-made to fulfill unique local needs? How should we communicate the value of using this new feature beyond Indeed our UI and policies? The bottom line is that we can fulfill all use cases while remaining flexible to adapt and change the matching product over time.

                                <p class="sec-text-dark">As the lead designer, I spent most of my time working with internal and external teams to address these questions - walking through the user journey, highlighting risks, common patterns, policy gaps, and data formats such as APIs and matching algorithms. Through countless sessions, we are able to identify shared resources, priorities, and a roadmap to ensure we move forward with maximum alignment and compatibility.
